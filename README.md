# Tailwind Layer Parser

---

**Layer Parser** lets you autocomplete and preview **custom css** that can be organized into directories and files while using the tailwind ecosystem.

This is extremely useful for mono-repos using similar design across several apps, and want to use a more familiar CSS language rather than specifying classes through tailwind's native JSON syntax.
